# Snake and its derivatives

This repository is for a fun project I took up for myself in summer '24. It might be a good way to learn and explore pygame as well as data structures grids grids, lists, vectors etc.

I would highly to thank creator of [this.](https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Snake) It has provided me good entry level pygame knowledge and helped me create something to test other stuff on top of snake.

Current progress:
- [x] Snake game: basic snake game in pygame that follows usually rules and can be controlled by user.
- [ ] Ekans : fun idea by me to start with more than half of board already covered by snake, every time apple is eaten snake reduces in size by one, you win when snake vanishes.
- [x] Hamiltonian Cycle solution: Automating snake movement, using hamiltonian cycle that gives guranteed solution. Hamiltonia cycles cover all the vertices (here, all squares on grid) without repeating any vertices and ends on starting node back again. My code of generation of cycle is not the greatest as of now but hey it works!
- [ ] A* algorithm: I plan to solve snake using A* or similar algorithm to make snake movement efficient. As of now, I understand that this has to go through many error checks as snake would trap itself on one side of board or within itself

I will also try to include more and more interesting stuff I find from various sources. Current suggestions include reinforcement learning.
